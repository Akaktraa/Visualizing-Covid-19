# Visualizing-Covid-19
            ##DataCamp Project-'Visualizing COVID-19'##
First, we load in the necessary packages and import the CSV files into R.

Then we first do the data visualization for cumulative cases vs Date.

Then we do data visualization for line plots of cumulative cases in China 
and Outside China. We see the cumulative cases outside china cross cumulative
case in China around Mid March.

Then we add trend lines using linear regression to line plots of cumulative cases
in China and Outside China. Using these plots we see that there is a linear trend in
cumulative cases increase in china while there was an exponential increase in cumulative
cases outside china till March.

Then we find the top 7 countries most affected by covid-19 by using the total cases metric.
We do this using tools provided in dplyr package.

Then we do the data visualization for cumulative cases of these top 7 countries 
affected by Covid-19.
